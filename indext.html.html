Hence he is also called ‘Trayambakam’. He burned the Kama with his third eye. <br>Lord Shiva is always surrounded by the ganas.<br> The upper part of the body and the waist remains covered with Tiger’s skin. He has matted hair with a beautiful crescent moon on his head. <br>He has a blue throat which is why he is also known as ‘Neelkantha Mahadev’.The body of Lord Shiva is covered with ashes. <br>He wears a snake who is called--‘Vasuki’and rudrakasha beads around his neck. Trishula (trident) and Damru are his two powerful weapons.<br> He spends most of his time meditating and practicing sadhna. <br>Lord Shiva sits with his consort Goddess Parvati at Kailash Parvat. </big></P></b>
